# -multi-UAV-simulator
GNC of a SWARM of UAVs in a SITL by Tom Antoine, Alex Martinez and Charalampos Efstratiou- Cranfield University AVDC MSc 2021

This project is composed of two independant but similar repositories:

Simulation_Python : it is used to do numerical simulations on the guidance algorithm fully on Python (https://github.com/tomAntoine/multi-UAV-simulator.git)
Simulation_Gazebo : here, the python code for guidance and navigation is used as SITL, for a Gazebo/ROS/Ardupilot world (below) and in (https://github.com/alexMarFar/multi-UAV-simulator.git)

# -Simulation_Gazebo
## Prerequisites:
Python 3.8.5 was employed, so full compability with that or after version Basic Python libraries such as matplotlib, math, etc

Install Ubuntu (version 20.04 employed, but 18.04 should also work)

Install Gazebo and ArduPilot Plugin (https://github.com/Intelligent-Quads/iq_tutorials/blob/master/docs/installing_gazebo_arduplugin.md)

Install ArduPilot and MAVProxy (https://github.com/Intelligent-Quads/iq_tutorials/blob/master/docs/Installing_Ardupilot_20_04.md)

Install ROS and Setup Catkin (noetic employed https://github.com/Intelligent-Quads/iq_tutorials/blob/master/docs/installing_ros_20_04.md, melodic should also work)

Repositories (iq_sim https://github.com/Intelligent-Quads/iq_sim)

Recommended: QGroundControl

All can be easily installed by following the tutorials below: https://github.com/Intelligent-Quads/iq_tutorials and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZy0c-uvSJglnZfQC0-uaQ

# -Main files

run_3D_simulation.py

It is the main script that launches the simulation. (Created by Tom Antoine and Alex Martinez)

Then the simulation is run by calling run_sim and the data can be visualized in plots or 3D animations. 

# - Other files 

multi_drone.launch

Launch file that connects quadcopters with Gazebo. 

multi-ardupilot.sh

Launch file that connects with Arducopter.

multi-apm.launch

Launch file that connects with ROS.

multi_drone.world

Contains the world with the drones.

# - Launch the simulation 
For every launch 
Open 1rst Terminal: 

``` cd catkin_ws/src/
roslaunch iq_sim multi_drone.launch
```
Open Terminal 2

cd
./multi-ardupilot.sh
Open Terminal 3

cd catkin_ws/src/
roslaunch iq_sim multi-apm.launch
Open Terminal 4

cd multi-UAV-simulator/Simulation_Gazebo/
python run_3D_simulation.py
