This project is composed of two independant but similar repositories:

Simulation_Python : it is used to do numerical simulations on the guidance algorithm fully on Python (https://github.com/tomAntoine/multi-UAV-simulator.git)
Simulation_Gazebo : here, the python code for guidance is used as SITL, for a Gazebo/ROS/Ardupilot world (below) and (https://github.com/alexMarFar/multi-UAV-simulator.git)
